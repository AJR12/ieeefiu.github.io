<p>Hello and welcome to the IEEE FIU Student Branch! This document is intended as a quick-start guide on how best to participate in our projects. As our organization evolves, it will be updated with more information and links to various projects we are working on.</p>

<a id="you-will-need" class="anchor" href="#you-will-need" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>You will need</h3>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> account. GitHub is a website for hosting projects created using Git, a version control tool created by Linus Torvalds. We have an <a href="https://github.com/ieeefiu">organization</a> on GitHub where our projects are hosted. Many of these repositories are private, so please create an account and let us know what your username is so you can have access.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://slack.com">Slack</a>. Slack is a messaging app for teams. It's like Internet Relay Chat but without the pain and anguish of setting up and maintaining an IRC server or trying to get people to use IRC in 2015. We use it for coordinating meetings, discussing project details, and updates. To get an invite to Slack, talk to David, Eli, Jason-Lee, or Will (or all of us at the same time). <em>Aside from face-to-face meetings, this is our primary method of communication.</em>

<p>Your enthusiasm is essential. We are seeking <em>true believers</em> who are willing to participate. That being said, this is a learning experience for all of us. We are not born knowing engineering, so there is no shame in asking questions or jumping on without knowing what to do. <em>None of us know what we are doing</em>, but we are hammering away as best we can to accomplish great things. All experience levels are welcome.</p>
