Shopping list for soldering workshop
====================================

Soldering iron
--------------

**Highly recommended**: [Hakko FX888D Soldering Station](http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-FX-888D/dp/B00ANZRT4M/)

It's temperature regulated, durable, and comes with a stand and sponge and tip cleaner. This iron will travel with you like a friend.

Decent: [Weller WLC100 Soldering Station](http://www.amazon.com/Weller-WLC100-40-Watt-Soldering-Station/dp/B000AS28UC/)

It has a knob to adjust temperature. The tip uses a setscrew so it will eventually get loose due to thermal expansion. It's better than a $10 iron picked from Radio Shack's rotting corpse, but the upgrade to the Hakko is *so worth it*. If you don't get the Hakko iron you should also buy [this](http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-599B-02-Solder-Cleaning-Holder/dp/B00FZPGDLA/).

Essentials
----------

- [Kester 44 Rosin Core Solder 63/37, 1 lb spool (this will last forever)](http://www.amazon.com/Kester-Rosin-Core-Solder-Spool/dp/B00068IJX6/)

We should have enough solder for the workshop, but you should absolutely get this solder. It's the best for small electronics work for a multitude of reasons and a pound of this stuff will last you a long time.

- [Hakko CHP170 Flush Wire Cutters (absolutely essential)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FZPDG1K/)

You will need these to clip the leads on components you solder.

- [Hakko CHP CSP 30-1 Wire Stripper (I promise I don't get kickbacks from Hakko, they just make good stuff)](http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CSP-30-1-Stripper-Maximum-Capacity/dp/B00FZPHMUG/)

Any decent wire strippers will do. A knife will not.

- [28AWG Wire](http://www.amazon.com/Stranded-Length-0-0126-Diameter-UL1007/dp/B00N51OU0W/)

This wire is good and cool and easy to solder with. You don't have to get this particular pack, but *please don't cut up your jumpers*.

Optional, but nice
------------------

- [MG Chemicals 835 Liquid Rosin Flux](http://www.amazon.com/MG-Chemicals-Corrosive-Conductive-residue/dp/B008UH4DT4/)
- A flux bottle. [This one](http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-900-230-Flux-Bottle-Pack/dp/B000BN390Y/) should be good enough.

Flux is a disgusting brown liquid that makes your solder stick better. You can solder without flux, but it makes it easier. That being said...

- [99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol](http://www.amazon.com/MG-Chemicals-Isopropyl-Alcohol-Cleaner/dp/B008UH4AI8/). Buy however much you're comfortable keeping on hand. Get [this](http://www.amazon.com/Beauticom-Alcohol-Dispenser--Bottle--Labeled/dp/B00LZGFK2G/) to keep it in for easy and safe dispensing.

99.9% isopropyl alcohol is good for cleaning boards, especially if you're using flux.

- [IC puller](http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Insulated-Vinyl-Puller/dp/B0002JEZ2I/)

You might have one of these stashed away in an old PC repair toolkit. They're great for pulling out integrated circuits without bending the pins.

- [Tweezers](http://www.amazon.com/Marrywindix-Tweezers-Non-magnetic-Forceps-Anti-static/dp/B00DVIEJ14/)

For when you're soldering surface mount components and your fingers are too big to hold them in place.

- [Helping Hand](http://www.amazon.com/Helping-Hand-01902-with-Magnifier/dp/B000P42O3C/)

I'm tempted to put this one in essentials because it's only $6, but I'll leave it to the reader to decide.

- [Desoldering pump](http://www.amazon.com/Parts-Express-Solder-Sucker--desoldering/dp/B015YVQ32S/)

Great for when you put an LED on backwards.
