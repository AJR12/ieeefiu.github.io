<h1>Soldering items</h1>

<p>This is a list of recommended purchases for having a decent home soldering setup. Not all of this will be necessary for the soldering workshop.</p>

<p>The bare minimum you will need for the workshop:</p>

<ul>
<li>Soldering iron</li>
<li>Flush Cutters</li>
<li>Wire Strippers</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that will be nice to have for the workshop:</p>

<ul>
<li>Helping Hands</li>
<li>Flux</li>
</ul>

<p>For the workshop, we will provide the solder and components so don't worry about bringing those. If you have anything you'd like to add to the optional portion of this list, message me (@wpo) on slack and I'll add it.</p>

<h2>Soldering iron</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Highly recommended</strong>: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-FX-888D/dp/B00ANZRT4M/">Hakko FX888D Soldering Station</a> - $90</li>
</ul>

<p>It's temperature regulated, durable, and comes with a stand and sponge and tip cleaner. This iron will travel with you like a friend.</p>

<ul>
<li>Decent: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Weller-WLC100-40-Watt-Soldering-Station/dp/B000AS28UC/">Weller WLC100 Soldering Station</a> - $40</li>
</ul>

<p>It has a knob to adjust temperature. The tip uses a setscrew so it will eventually get loose due to thermal expansion. It's better than a $10 iron picked from Radio Shack's rotting corpse, but the upgrade to the Hakko is <em>so worth it</em>. If you don't get the Hakko iron you should also buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-599B-02-Solder-Cleaning-Holder/dp/B00FZPGDLA/">this</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cheap: <strong>If $40 is too much to spend on a soldering iron, wait until you can afford a soldering iron.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Essential tools</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kester-Rosin-Core-Solder-Spool/dp/B00068IJX6/">Kester 44 Rosin Core Solder 63/37, 1 lb spool (this will last forever)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We should have enough solder for the workshop, but you should absolutely get this solder. It's the best for small electronics work for a multitude of reasons and a pound of this stuff will last you a long time.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FZPDG1K/">Hakko CHP170 Flush Wire Cutters (absolutely essential)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You will need these to clip the leads on components you solder.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hakko-CSP-30-1-Stripper-Maximum-Capacity/dp/B00FZPHMUG/">Hakko CHP CSP 30-1 Wire Stripper (I promise I don't get kickbacks from Hakko, they just make good stuff)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any decent wire strippers will do. A knife will not.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stranded-Length-0-0126-Diameter-UL1007/dp/B00N51OU0W/">28AWG Wire</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This wire is good and cool and easy to solder with. You don't have to get this particular pack, but <em>please don't cut up your jumpers</em>.</p>

<h2>Optional, but nice</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MG-Chemicals-Corrosive-Conductive-residue/dp/B008UH4DT4/">MG Chemicals 835 Liquid Rosin Flux</a></li>
<li>A flux bottle. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-900-230-Flux-Bottle-Pack/dp/B000BN390Y/">This one</a> should be good enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flux is a disgusting brown liquid that makes your solder stick better. You can solder without flux, but it makes it easier. That being said...</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MG-Chemicals-Isopropyl-Alcohol-Cleaner/dp/B008UH4AI8/">99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol</a>. Buy however much you're comfortable keeping on hand. Get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beauticom-Alcohol-Dispenser--Bottle--Labeled/dp/B00LZGFK2G/">this</a> to keep it in for easy and safe dispensing.</li>
</ul>

<p>99.9% isopropyl alcohol is good for cleaning boards, especially if you're using flux.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Steel-Insulated-Vinyl-Puller/dp/B0002JEZ2I/">IC puller</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You might have one of these stashed away in an old PC repair toolkit. They're great for pulling out integrated circuits without bending the pins.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Marrywindix-Tweezers-Non-magnetic-Forceps-Anti-static/dp/B00DVIEJ14/">Tweezers</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For when you're soldering surface mount components and your fingers are too big to hold them in place.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Helping-Hand-01902-with-Magnifier/dp/B000P42O3C/">Helping Hand</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm tempted to put this one in essentials because it's only $6, but I'll leave it to the reader to decide.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Parts-Express-Solder-Sucker--desoldering/dp/B015YVQ32S/">Desoldering pump</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Great for when you put an LED on backwards.</p>
